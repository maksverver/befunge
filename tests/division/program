v  This file checks correctness of division and modulo instructions when applied
   to negative and zero values.  Expected behaviour is for division to round
   the result towards zero, and the modulo operator to be consistent with
   division such that a=(a/b)*b+(a%b).
> 92/.      v  9/2 should yield 4 (round towards zero)
v           <
> 92%.      v  9%2 should give 1 since 9=4*2+1
v           <

v           <
> 07-3%.    v  -7%3 should give -1 since -7=-2*3-1
v           <
> 703-/.    v  7/-3 should give -2 (same as -7/3)
v           <
